<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>MILTON AND MALATESTI.</h3>

<p>About nine years after Milton visited Italy, he
thus briefly noticed, in letter to Carlo Dati, his
surviving Florentine friends:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Carolo <span class="sc">Dato</span> patricio Florentino.... Tu interim,
mi Carole, valebis, et Cultellino, Francino, Frescobaldo,
Malatestæ, Clementillo minori, et si quem
alium nostri amantiorem novisti; toti denique Gaddianæ
academiæ, salutem meo nomine plurimam dices.
Interim vale.&mdash;<i>Londino</i>, Aprilis 21. 1647."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The above extract is from <i>The prose works of
John Milton</i>, as printed in 1806, and I shall add to
it the translation by Robert Fellowes, A.M., from
the same edition:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To Carolo <span class="sc">Deodati</span>, a Florentine noble.... In
the mean time, my dear Charles, farewell, and present
my kind wishes to Cultellino, Francisco, Trescobaldo,
Malatesto, the younger Clemantillo, and every other
inquiring friend, and to all the members of the Gaddian
academy. Adieu.&mdash;<i>London</i>, April 21. 1647."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Warton states, in a note on the minor poems of
Milton, that Mr. Brand discovered, on a book-stall,
a manuscript of <i>La tina</i> of Malatesti, <i>dedicated
to Milton while at Florence</i>, and that he
gave it to Mr. Hollis, who sent it in 1758, together
with the works of Milton, to the Accademia
della Crusca. Warton justly observes, "The first
piece would have been a greater curiosity in England."
With these facts the information of the
most recent biographers of Milton seems to terminate.
I am enabled, however, to prove that the
work is <span class="sc">in print</span>, and shall transcribe my authority
<i>verbatim</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="sc">Malatesti</span>, <i>Antonio</i>. <span class="sc">La tina</span>, equivoci rusticali (in
50 sonetti). Londra, Tommaso Edlin, 1757, in 8ᵒ.</p>

<p><i>Non è fatta in Londra quest' ediz. nel 1757, ma presso
che 80 anni dopo in Venezia, ed in numero di 50 esemplari
in carta velina, due in carta grande inglese da disegno, ed
uno, unico, in</i> <span class="sc">pergamena</span>.</p>

<p>Il Malatesti aveva regalato una copia di questi
graziosissimi sonetti al celebre inglese Gio. Milton,
nell' anno in cui egli visitava l'Italia. Dopo la morte
del Milton pervennero in mano del sig. Brant, gentiluomo
inglese, il quale una copia ne fece trarre per<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>{238}</span>
regalarla a Gio. Marsili, prof. dell' Università di Padova,
che nel 1757 si trovava in Londra. Il <span class="allsmcap">MS.</span> del
Marsili servì a questa ristampa che porta in fronte
quella stessa prefazione in inglese che stava nel <span class="allsmcap">MS.</span>
Marsiliano."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The authority alluded to is the fourth edition of
the <i>Serie dei testi di lingua</i> of Bartolommeo Gamba,
Venezia, 1839, royal 8vo.&mdash;one of the best bibliographical
compilations ever produced. I was led
to suspect, on glancing at the note, that Gamba
himself was the editor of the volume, and now
consider it as certain, for <i>La tina</i> appears under his
name in the index. As copies of the work must
have reached England I hope to see the dedication
reprinted, and am sure it would be received as a
welcome curiosity.</p>

<p>I cannot commend Mr. Fellowes as a translator
of Milton. <i>To Carolo</i> is a solecism; <i>Deodati</i>
should be <i>Dati</i>; the period which precedes the
extract is entirely omitted; and the five names
which follow <i>Charles</i>, besides being mis-spelt, have
the termination which can only be required in
Latin composition! I believe we should read
Coltellini, Francini, Frescobaldi, Malatesti, and
Clementini. On Coltellini and Malatesti there is
much valuable information in Poggiali and Gamba.</p>

<h3>"THAT SWINNEY."</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Continued from</i> p. 215.)</p>

<p>Swinney was the devoted servant of all men in
power&mdash;of all who had been or were likely to be in
power&mdash;except, perhaps, the peace-makers, who,
curiously enough, did not please this minister of
peace&mdash;of all, perhaps, who subscribed to his publications,
or had the means to subscribe; and
who, if they did not, might hereafter. Swinney's
volume of <i>Fugitive Pieces</i> was dedicated to the
Duke of Grafton. A third edition contains additions
which show how Swinney's great zeal outran his
little discretion. The following verses appeared
originally in <i>The Public Advertiser</i> on the 27th of
May, 1768, and are bad enough to be preserved
as a curiosity:</p>

<p class="center"><i>"An Extempore Effusion on reading a Scurrilous Invective
against the Duke of G&mdash;&mdash;n [Grafton],
published in yesterday's Newspapers.</i></p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>Cursed be the Wretch, and blasted rot his name,</p>
    <p>Who dares to stab an injured G&mdash;&mdash;n's fame!</p>
    <p>Who (while his public virtue stands confest,</p>
    <p>And lives within his <span class="sc">Royal Master's</span> breast)</p>
    <p>Can rake for Scandal in his private life,</p>
    <p>And widen breaches between man and wife;</p>
    <p>Who casts a stone (like some unthinking Elf),</p>
    <p>That haply shall recoil against himself!</p>
    <p>Anguish, Remorse, and Terror seize his Soul,</p>
    <p>And waste it quick where fiends malicious howl;</p>
    <p>May those rank pests through which his father fell,</p>
    <p>Announce his coming to the Gates of Hell!</p>
    <p>And yet, or ere he plunge into the Lake,</p>
    <p>Where no cool stream his endless thirst can slake,</p>
    <p>May <span class="sc">Christ</span> in mercy deprecate his doom,</p>
    <p>And may to <span class="sc">Him</span> his promised Kingdom come!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="i12">"<span class="sc">Sidney Swinney.</span>"</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Not content with future punishment, the Doctor,
in another poem, threatens present vengeance:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"But hark thee, wretch; believe him while he swears;</p>
    <p><span class="sc">Sid</span> (by the gods) will crop thine asses ears,</p>
    <p>Should thou persist a G&mdash;&mdash;n to impeach,</p>
    <p>And blast those virtues thou canst never reach."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>As Draper had taken Granby under his protection,
so Swinney must needs play the chivalrous
in defence of Grafton. The dedication of <i>The
Battle of Minden</i> is dated 20th May, 1769, and the
poet in the <i>exordium</i> goes out of his way to notice,
as I suppose, the attacks of Junius:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"His [Sid's] blood recoils with an indignant rage,</p>
    <p>'Gainst the base hirelings of a venal age.</p>
    <p>Wretches! that spare nor ministers nor kings,</p>
    <p>Blend good with bad, profane with sacred things;</p>
    <p>Whose vengeful hearts, with wrath and malice curst,</p>
    <p>Blast virtuous deeds; and then, with envy burst,</p>
    <p>They dart their arrows, innocence traduce,</p>
    <p>And load e'en G&mdash;&mdash;n with their vile abuse."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>To this passage he appends the following note,
which occupies, in his magnificent typographical
volume, a whole quarto page:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is observable that this amiable personage [the
Duke of Grafton], and most consummate statesman,
has been bespattered with as much low calumny and
abuse, from various quarters, as if he had been the
declared enemy of his country, instead of having manfully
and courageously stood up in support of its true
interests.&mdash;S."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Let us consider now, What are the probabilities
of Swinney never having spoken to Lord George
Sackville?</p>

<p>That he did on that occasion speak to Lord
George&mdash;that he did ask him "whether or no he
was the author of Junius"&mdash;may be assumed:
and it is very probable that Junius heard of it, at
first or at second hand, from Swinney himself; for
the impertinent blockhead that would ask such a
question, was just the man to tell what he had
done, and to think it a good thing. But had he
never before spoken to Sackville? Was this a
fact or a flourish&mdash;an affectation of secret information,
like the "sent" and "went" about
Garrick&mdash;the "every particular next day"&mdash;which
we now know to have been untrue.</p>

<p>That Swinney had been chaplain to one of the
British regiments serving in Germany is manifest
from twenty different references in the poem and
the notes. I lay no stress on his poetical flights
about Euphorbus; but he speaks repeatedly from
personal experience&mdash;specially refers to circumstances
occurring when quartered at a farm-house
near Embden&mdash;at the camp at Crossdorf&mdash;acknowledges
personal favours received during the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>{239}</span>
campaign from General Harvey, and on another
occasion attentions from Granby. Here, for example,
is a poetical picture which brings Swinney
vividly before us:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"At Marienbourn, the vaunting army halts,</p>
    <p class="i8">...</p>
    <p><i>A pastor</i> from the heav'n-devoted train,</p>
    <p>Brings hams and fowls, and spreads them on the plain:</p>
    <p>The jovial officers their bellies fill,</p>
    <p><i>Rally their chaplain</i>, and applaud him still."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Swinney must therefore have served under
Sackville; for, as he tells us, Sackville</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="i8">"by George was made</p>
    <p>Good Marlbro's successor"&mdash;</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>and certainly the probabilities are that he must
have been personally known to&mdash;had before
spoken to him. Sackville must at this very time
have been particularly anxious about Swinney
and his doings, wise or unwise. That fatal battle
of Minden had been the ruin of all his hopes&mdash;the
overthrow of all his ambition. In my opinion,
Sackville had been shamefully and shamelessly
run down on that occasion; but whether justly or
unjustly stripped of his honours and degraded for
his conduct, here was a man about to write
a poem on the battle, to immortalise those who
fought in it; and Sackville must have been keenly
alive to what he might say of him. Swinney
foreshadowed what his opinion would be in the
First Book, where he enumerates Sackville
amongst his "choice leaders"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Good Marlbro', Sackville, Granby, Waldgrave bold,</p>
    <p>Brudenell and Kingsley."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This was published early in 1769.</p>

<p>In the Second Book Lord George is brought
prominently forward. The "bewilder'd Ferdinand,"
"doubtful himself," summons a council of
war, and calls first on Sackville for advice.</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Sackville, disclose the secret of thy breast:</p>
    <p>Say, shall we linger in ignoble rest?</p>
    <p>Shall we retreat? advance, or perish here?</p>
    <p>Resolve our queries: state thy judgment clear."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Sackville now plays the "high heroical," and
talks through six pages; but to what purpose I
am unable to conjecture. There <i>seems</i> to be a
great deal of angry remonstrance&mdash;of offensive
remonstrance:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"When I ask [says Sackville to Ferdinand], didst ever thou consult</p>
    <p>A chief, till now, and wait the sage result?</p>
    <p>When Aalm's camp was deluged all in rain,</p>
    <p>And floods rusht o'er an undistinguisht plain,</p>
    <p>To thy flint heart remonstrances were vain:</p>
    <p>What, then, avail'd neglected Marlbro's prayers!</p>
    <p>His instances? His unremitted cares?</p>
    <p>The Elector's stables had sufficient room,</p>
    <p>Stalls, without end, anticipate the doom</p>
    <p>Of British chargers, forced to march, at noon,</p>
    <p>Beneath their riders' weight and scorching sun."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Swinney then gives in a note what he calls the
genuine queries proposed by Prince Ferdinand,
with Sackville's answer: which answer is nearly
as void of distinct meaning as the poetry, but in
favour I think of risking a battle. The general purport,
however, foreshadows what Swinney's conclusion
would have been&mdash;that Sackville, the friend of
the British soldier, protested against the frauds by
which they were robbed and starved; protested
against their being called on to do all the work,
and run all the risks of the campaign; and disdains
to humour or flatter Prince Ferdinand.
These were, in brief, the explanations given by
Sackville's friends as the cause of his disgrace&mdash;Granby
the favoured, a gallant soldier indeed,
but a mere soldier, being comparatively indifferent
about such commissarial matters, and much more
easily deceived by the cunning of the selfish Germans
and English. This intention is made still
more clear in another note, wherein Swinney
states:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We may be enabled to account for a certain disgraceful
event, in some future observation of ours,
equally to <i>the honour of the person disgraced</i>, and to the
innocent cause of that disgrace."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Under these circumstances there can be little
doubt that Sidney Swinney, D.D., was the party
alluded to by Junius; as little, I think, that Swinney
had before, and long before, spoken to Lord George
Sackville,&mdash;must have been dear to Sackville, as
one of the few who had served under, and yet had a
kind word to say for him,&mdash;had said it indeed, and
was about to repeat it emphatically. That Swinney
was the fool Junius asserted, the extract already
given must have abundantly proved; but I
will conclude with one other, in which he not
only anticipated Fitzgerald, but anticipated the
burlesque exaggerations in the "Rejected Addresses:"</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Horse, Foot, Hussars, or ere they march review'd.</p>
    <p class="i8">...</p>

    <p>Their bold cock'd hats, their spatterdashers white,</p>

<h3>TOM, MYTHIC AND MATERIAL.</h3>

<p>"All <i>Toms</i> are alike," quoth the elegant Pelham;
and if we were asked to define the leading idea of
him, we should describe a downright honest John
Bull, essentially manly, but withal a bit&mdash;perhaps
a large bit&mdash;of a dullard. His masculinity is unquestionable.
A male cat, as every body knows,
is a <i>Tom</i>-cat; a romping boy-like girl is a <i>Tom</i>-boy,
or a <i>Tom</i>-rig; a large nob-headed pin is a
<i>Tom</i>-pin; and in many provincial dialects the
great toe is, <i>par excellence</i>, the <i>Tom</i>-toe. Last, not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>{240}</span>
least, there is the nectar of St. Giles, the venerable
Old <i>Tom</i>. In proof of his stupidity we can adduce
a goodly show of epithets&mdash;<i>Tom</i>-fool, <i>Tom</i>-neddy,
<i>Tom</i>-noddy, <i>Tom</i>-cull, <i>Tom</i>-coney, <i>Tom</i>-farthing,
&amp;c. We know, indeed, there are people who hold
that even in these instances <i>Tom</i> is merely the
masculine prefix to distinguish the <i>he</i>-fool (<i>i. e.</i>
the <i>Tom</i>-fool) from the Molly or <i>she</i>-fool of the
ancient mumming. But the race of Toms must
not lay this flattering unction to their souls, for
the hypothesis won't stand. The very monosyllable
itself, like "Sammy," has a strong twang of the
bauble in it. An open truth-loving fellow is a
<i>Tom</i> Tell-truth; but, on the other hand, all
tinkers&mdash;a sadly libelled race of men&mdash;are invariably
<i>Tom</i>-tinkers, as all tars have been <i>Jack</i>-tars from
time immemorial. In some of the old-fashioned
country games at cards the knave is called <i>Tom</i>;
and the wandering mendicants who used to levy
black-mail, under the plea of insanity, were Mad
<i>Toms</i>, or "<i>Toms</i>-o'-Bedlam." "Tom all alone"
is a northern <i>sobriquet</i> for the Wandering Jew,
who, the last time we heard of him, was caught
stealing gingerbread nuts at Richmond Fair. In
the legendary division there is the notorious <i>Tom</i>-Styles&mdash;the
depredatory <i>Tom</i> the piper's son
(legitimate issue of <i>Tom</i> Piper, the musician of
the old Morris Dance)&mdash;the fortunate <i>Tom</i> Tidler
of the original diggings, and that heroic little liege
of Queen Mab, the knight of the thumb. <i>Tom</i>-Tumbler
was a saltatory fiend in the days of Reginald
Scott; and <i>Tom</i> Poker still devours little
folks in Suffolk, without doubt (thinks Forby) a
descendant of the Sui.-G. <i>tompte poecke</i>, or house-goblin.
As for the ignominious <i>Tom</i> Tiler (North
Country for hen-pecked husband) we cannot
allow him to belong to the family; for who can
imagine a hen-pecked Tom! he must have been
a wretched individuality, a suffering, corporeal
Tiler.</p>

<p>Tom also bestows his name on divers other
things, animate and inanimate. Among fishes
there are <i>Tommy</i>-Loach, <i>Tommy</i>-Bar, and <i>Tom</i>-Toddy
(the Cornish name of the tod-pole). The
Long-<i>Tom</i> and the <i>Tom</i>-tit are both ornithological
Toms. Tom Tailor is a child's name for the
Harry-long-legs&mdash;another singular instance, by
the way, of Christian names applied to animals.
<i>Tom</i>-trot reminds one of pre-pantaloon orgies,
and is (I think) something in the brandy-ball line.
Finally, we may remark, that a large proportion
of her Majesty's subjects are in the habit of conferring
the endearing name upon the staff of life
itself. "Navvies," agricultural labourers, and
such like gentry, are accustomed to divide all
human food into two classes, which they euphonically
denominate respectively <i>Todge</i> and <i>Tommy</i>;
the former comprising spoon-meat, and the latter
all hard food which requires mastication. But
this, we think, is not a case of Tom <i>per se</i>, but
rather referable to the Camb.-Brit. <i>tama</i>, which
has exactly the same acceptation.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

<p><i>Shakspearian Parallels.</i>&mdash;Searching for Shakspearian
parallels, I find the following, which may
leave suggested to our bard his <i>Seven Ages</i>. The
first is by Solon, extracted from Clemens Alexandrinus
(<i>Stromat.</i> vi. p. 685., Paris, 1629), which
differs from Philo Judæus (i. p. 25.), the only two
authorities to whom we owe the preservation of
this ode, as also from the text of the critic Brunck
and the grammarian Dalzell. An imitation of the
Greek metres is attempted in the paraphrased
translation attached. The second is a sonnet from
Tusser, who extends the period of life beyond
seventy, the age of Solon and David in hotter
climes, to eighty-four for hyperboreans, but assigns,
with David, the imbecility belonging to
such advanced years.</p>

<p><i>"Contents dies"&mdash;Love's Labour's Lost, Act V.
Sc. 2.</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 120. 169.).&mdash;I must be
permitted, with all due courtesy, to correct <span class="sc">Mr.
Arrowsmith's</span> assertion respecting this phrase;
because, from its dogmatic tone, it is calculated
to mislead readers, and perhaps editors. He
maintains that this is a good concord, and pronounces
Johnson and Collier (myself, of course,
included) to be "unacquainted with the usage of
their own tongue, and the universal language of
thought," for not discerning it.</p>

<p>Now it may, perhaps, surprise <span class="sc">Mr. Arrowsmith</span>
to be told that he has proved nothing&mdash;that not a
single one of his instances is relevant. In this
passage the verb is <i>neuter</i> or <i>active</i>; in all of his
quotations it is the verb <i>substantive</i> we meet.
Surely one so well versed, as we must suppose him
to be, in general grammar, requires not to be told
that this verb takes the same case after as before
it, and that the governing case often follows.
Indeed, he has recognised this principle by giving
"This is the contents thereof" as one of his instances
of "contents" governing a singular verb.
Let him then produce an <i>exact</i> parallel to "contents
dies," or even such a structure as this, "the contents
<i>is</i> lies and calumnies," and then we may
hearken to him. Till that has been done, my interpretation
is the only one that gives sense to the
passage without altering the text.</p>

<p>An exact parallel to the sense in which I take
"contents" is found in&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"But heaven hath a hand in these events,</p>

<p>In conclusion, I must add that I still regard this
emendatory criticism as a "game," the Latin
<i>ludus</i>, as it gives scope to sagacity and ingenuity,
but can rarely hope to arrive at certainty; and it
does not, like questions of ethics or politics, involve
important interests, and should never excite our
angry feelings. As to "cogging and falsification,"
which <span class="sc">Mr. A.</span> joins with it, they can have no just
reference to <i>me</i>, as I have never descended to the
employment of such artifices.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Thos. Keightley.</span></p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;I have just seen H. C. K.'s observation
on "clamour your tongues" in the <i>Winter's Tale</i>,
and it really seems strange that he should not
have read, or should have forgotten my view of it
in "N. &amp; Q.," which is precisely similar to his
own. As to suspecting him of pilfering from me,
nothing is farther from my thoughts.</p>

<p><i>Meaning of Delighted.</i>&mdash;With reference to the
word <i>delighted</i> in Shakspeare, much discussed in
"N. &amp; Q.," may I remind you that we call that
which carries (or is furnished, or provided with)
wings, <i>winged</i>; that which carries wheels, <i>wheeled</i>;
that which carries masts, <i>masted</i>; and so on. Why
then should not a pre-Johnsonian writer call that
which carries delight, <i>delighted</i>? It appears to
me that this will sufficiently explain "delighted
beauty;" and "the delighted spirit" I would
account for in the same way: only remarking that
in this case, the borne delights meant are delights
to the bearer; in the other case, delights to all
whom the bearer approaches.</p>

<h3>Minor Notes.</h3>

<p><i>Gray&mdash;"The ploughman homeward plods."</i>&mdash;On
looking over some MSS. which I had not seen

a copy:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A person had a paper folded with this line from
Gray marked on it&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">

<p>A poetical friend, on looking at the quotation, thought
it might be expressed in various ways without destroying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>{242}</span>
the rhyme, or altering the sense. In a short time
he produced the following eleven different readings.
It is doubtful whether another line can be found, the
words of which admit of so many transpositions, and
still retain the original meaning:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<p><i>"Aquæ in Vinum conversæ. Vidit et erubuit lympha
pudica Deum."</i>&mdash;The interesting note under
this title (Vol. vi., p. 358.) refers to Campbell's
<i>Poets</i>. The following is an extract from Campbell:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Richard Crashaw there [Cambridge] published his
Latin poems, in one of which is the epigram from a
Scripture passage:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"<i>Lympha</i> pudica Deum vidit et <i>erubuit</i>.'"</p>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="i4">Campbell's <i>Brit. Poets</i>, ed. 1841, p. 198.</p>
  </div>
</div>

</blockquote>

<p>In the <i>Poemata Anglorum Latina</i> is the following
epigram on our Saviour's first miracle at the
marriage feast:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Unde rubor vestris et non sua purpura lymphis,</p>
    <p>Quæ rosa mirantes tam nova mutat aquas?</p>
    <p>Numen (convivæ) præsens agnoscite numen&mdash;</p>
    <p>Vidit et erubuit <i>nympha</i> pudica Deum."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I presume this epigram is Crashaw's poem to
which Campbell refers; but query. Until I saw
the note in "N. &amp; Q.," I supposed that the celebrated
line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Lympha pudica Deum vidit et erubuit."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>was the happy <i>ex tempore</i> produce of Dryden's
early genius, when a boy, at Westminster School.
If the epigram which I have copied is the original,
the last line is surely much improved by the (traditional)
line which Campbell has recorded. Surely
<i>lympha</i> is preferable to <i>nympha</i>; and surely the
order of the word erubuit ending the line is the
best.</p>

<p><i>Spurious Edition of Baily's "Annuities"</i> (Vol. iv.,
p. 19.).&mdash;In the place just referred to, I pointed
out how to distinguish the spurious editions, among
other marks, by the <i>title-page</i>. I looked at a copy
on a stall a few days ago, and found that <i>the title-page
has been changed</i>. Those who have reprinted
it have chosen the old title-page, which
stood in the work before two volumes were made

<p><i>"Illustrium Poetarum Flores."</i>&mdash;On leaving
London I thought of bringing with me two or
three pocket classics; unfortunately, in looking
for them, I picked up <i>Illustrium Poetarum Flores
per Octavianum Mirandulam olim Collecti</i>, &amp;c.,
Londini, 1651, and brought that little book with
me instead; and, upon looking into it, I find it the
worst printed book I ever saw; and I send you
this Note as to it, as a warning against so disgraceful
a publication. Such a work, if well
executed and properly printed, would be a very
pleasant companion in a vacation ramble.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>SAMUEL WILSON.</h3>

<p>I should be glad of any information respecting
Samuel Wilson, Esq., of Hatton Garden, in the
parish of St. Andrew, Holborn, whose will was
proved October 24, 1769, and which I have read.
He was the donor of the bequest, known as
"Wilson's Charity," to the Corporation of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>{243}</span>
City of London, for loans to poor tradesmen. I
wish to ask,&mdash;</p>

<p>1. What is known of his origin, family, personal
history, &amp;c.?</p>

<p>2. What was his precise degree of relationship
to the Halseys, whom he calls "cousins" in his
will? Were they related to the family of that
name at Great Gaddesden, Herts?</p>

<p>3. Did he publish any, and what, letters or
books? for he leaves his MSS. of every kind to
his friend Richard Glover, Esq. (the poet I presume),
with full power to collect any letters or
papers he may have already published, and also
to arrange and publish any more which he may
think intended or suitable for publication.</p>

<p>4. Is there any published sketch of his life?
The only notice I have seen is the one of a few
lines in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, just after his
death.</p>

<p>In compliance with your excellent suggestion
(Vol. vii., p. 2.), I send my address in a stamped
envelope for any private communication which
may not interest the general reader.</p>

<p><i>The Yew Tree in Village Churchyards.</i>&mdash;Why
did our forefathers choose the yew as the inseparable
attendant upon the outer state of the churches

sombre appearance, I cannot help recognising a
mysterious embodiment of the spirit of evil as the
intention of the planters. We know that in all
mediæval edifices there is an apparent and discernible
endeavour to place in juxta-position the
spirits of good and evil, to <i>materialise</i> the idea of
an adversative spirit, antagonistic to the church's
teachings, and hurtful to her efforts of advancement.
I look upon the grotesque cephalic corbels
as one modification of this, and would interpret
many equally mysterious emblems by referring
them to the same actuating desire. Now the yew
is certainly the most deadly of indigenous productions,
and therefore would be chosen as the
representative of a spirit of destruction, the opposite
to one that giveth life by its teachings, of
which the building itself is the sensible sign. I
crave more information from some learned ecclesiologist
on the subject, which is certainly a most
interesting one.</p>

<p><i>"An" before "u" long.</i>&mdash;I should be much
obliged to any of my fellow-students of "N. &amp; Q."
who would answer the following Query: What
is the reason of the increasingly prevailing custom
of writing <i>an</i> before words beginning with <i>u</i> long,
or with diphthongs having the sound of <i>u</i> long?
Surely a written language is perfect in proportion
as it represents the spoken tongue; if so, this is
one of the many instances in which modern
fashions are making English orthography still
more inconsistent than it was wont to be. It appears
to me just as reasonable to say "<i>an youthful</i>
(pronounced <i>yoothful</i>) person," as "<i>an useful</i>
(pronounced <i>yooseful</i>) person."</p>

<p>If there is a satisfactory reason for the practice,
I shall be delighted to be corrected but, if not, I

<p><i>Reversible Names.</i>&mdash;Some female names spell

Is this in the nature of things, or can any one produce
a reversible <i>proprium quod maribus</i>? No
arguments, but instances; no surnames, which are
epicene; no obsolete names, such as <i>Odo</i>, of which
it may be suspected that they have died precisely
because an attempt was made to marify them: or
say, rather, that Odo, to live masculine, was obliged
to become Otho. Failing instances, I shall maintain
that <i>varium et mutabile semper femina</i> only
means that whatever reads backwards and forwards
the same, is always feminine.</p>

Are there any engravings of these monuments?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>{245}</span>
And if so, in what work; or where are the inscriptions

yielding no more than 80<i>l.</i> a year.' The editor has not

and in the folio edition, p. 57.:&mdash;"Cardinal Fleury
wanted much to see him [the bishop], and sent over
on purpose to inquire after his health, his age,
and the date of his consecration; as they were the
two oldest bishops, and he believed the poorest, in
Europe; at the same time inviting him to France.
The Bishop sent the Cardinal an answer, which gave
him so high an opinion of him, that he obtained an
order that no French privateer should ravage the Isle
of Man." Feltham, in his <i>Tour through the Isle of Man</i>,

but was neither acted nor printed. In a pamphlet,
entitled <i>Historical Memoirs of the Life and Writings of

<h3>JACOB BÖHME, OR BEHMEN.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. viii., p. 13.)</p>

<p>Some farther particulars respecting the writings
of that remarkable character, who, according to
your correspondent, "led astray William Law,
and through him tinctured the religious philosophy
of Coleridge, and from whom Schelling stole
the corner-stones of his <i>Philosophy of Nature</i>,"
may perhaps interest the readers of "N. &amp; Q."</p>

<p>Who Böhme, or Behmen, was, may be seen by
a reference to Francis Okely's <i>Memoir</i> of him,
and to the article in the <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i> (vol. v.
p. 61.) written by Dr. Bialloblotzky; which, with
the exception of a few trifling errors, is carefully
compiled. The true character of his philosophy
has been ably and fully described in the later
writings of William Law, especially in his <i>Animadversions
on Dr. Trapp</i> (at the end of <i>An Appeal
to all that Doubt or Disbelieve the Truths of Revelation</i>);
in <i>The Way to Divine Knowledge</i>; <i>The
Spirit of Love</i>; his <i>Letters</i>; and in the fragment
of a <i>Dialogue</i>, prefixed to the first of the four
volumes in 4to. of Behmen's <i>Works</i>.</p>

<p>Behmen's writings first became generally known
in this country by translations of the most important
of them by a gentleman of the name of
Ellistone, and of minor ones by Mr. Humphrey
Blunden and others. Ellistone dying before he
had completed the translation of the great work
upon <i>Genesis</i>, it was continued by his cousin,
John Sparrow, a barrister in the Temple; who
also translated and published the remainder of
Behmen's writings in the English language. Respecting
these individuals, William Law, in a
letter written in reply to one received from a
Mr. Stephen Penny, speaks in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The translators of Jacob Behmen, Ellistone and
Sparrow, are much to be honoured for their work;
they had great piety and great abilities, and well apprehended
their author, especially Ellistone: but the
translation is <i>too much loaded with words</i>, and in many
places <i>the sense is mistaken</i>.<a name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p>"A new translator of Jacob Behmen is not to have
it in intention to make his author more intelligible by
softening or refining his language. His style is what
it is, strange and uncommon; not because he wanted
learning and skill in words, but because what he saw
and conceived was quite new and strange, never seen
or spoken of before; and therefore if he was to put it
down in writing, words must be used to signify that
which they had never done before.</p>

<p>"If it shall please God that I undertake this work,
I shall only endeavour to make Jacob Behmen speak
as he would have spoken, had he wrote in English.
Secondly, to guard the reader at certain places from
wrong apprehensions of his meaning, by adding here
and there a note, as occasion requires. Thirdly, and
chiefly, by Prefaces or Introductions to prepare and
direct the reader in the true use of these writings.
This last is most of all necessary, and yet would be entirely
needless, if the reader would but observe Jacob
Behmen's own directions. For there is not an error,
defect, or wrong turn, which the reader can fall into,
in the use of these books, but is most plainly set before
him by Jacob Behmen.</p>

<p>"Many persons of learning in the last century read
Jacob Behmen with great earnestness; but it was only,
as it were, to steal from him certain mysteries of
Nature, and to run away with the philosopher's stone;
and yet nowhere could they see the folly and impossibility
of their attempt so fully shown them, as by
Jacob Behmen himself."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>A well-engraved portrait of John Sparrow may
occasionally be met with in some of the small
quarto English treatises of Behmen.</p>

<p>The four-volume edition of Jacob Behmen's
<i>Works</i>, in large 4to., 1764-81, is an unsatisfactory
performance; having, in fact, nothing in common
with the projected edition by William Law, as
expressed in the above letter. Nevertheless, it
has been useful in many respects; especially as
being instrumental in making the productions of
Dion. Andreas Freher more generally known.
This edition, moreover, is incomplete; as several
important treatises, besides his Letters, are entirely
omitted. The order, too, in which the pieces
are inserted from the <i>Book of the Incarnation</i> is
altogether wrong.</p>

<p>It is a common, but erroneous supposition, that
William Law was the editor of this edition. From
his work, <i>The Way to Divine Knowledge</i>, printed
some years after the date of the letter quoted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>{247}</span>
above, it appears that he intended to publish a
new and correct translation of Behmen's <i>Works</i>;
but did not survive to accomplish it. He died in
1761, before the first of the four volumes was
published; and if he were in any way identified
with it, it could only be by some one or two of his
corrections (found in his own copy of the <i>Works</i>
after his decease) being incorporated therein; but
of this there is some uncertainty. The Symbols,
or Emblems, which are stated in the title-page of
this edition to have been "left by Mr. Law," were
not his production, but merely copies of the
originals themselves. These were all designed by
the above Dionysius Andreas Freher, a learned
German, who had resided in this country from
about the year 1695 till his death in 1728, in
illustration of his own systematic elucidations of
the ground and principles of the central philosophy
of Deity and Nature, opened as a new
original, and <i>final</i> revelation from God, in "his
chosen instrument, Behmen." It was, I believe,
from Freher, that Francis Lee (see "N. &amp; Q."
Vol. ii., p. 355.) became so deeply versed in the
scope and design of high supersensual and mystical
truth. From the year 1740, Freher, by his
writings, demonstrations and diagrams, may be
considered the <i>closet-tutor</i> of William Law at his
philosophical retreat at King's Cliffe, in respect to
the great mysteries of Truth and Nature, the
origin and constitution of things, glanced at in
what are popularly called Law's later or mystical
writings.</p>

<p>Next to Behmen's <i>Works</i>, and coupled with
those of Law, Freher's writings and illustrations
must, in regard to theosophical science, be considered
the most valuable and important in existence.
Freher also was personally acquainted with
Gichtel, who was deeply imbued with the philosophy
of Jacob Behmen, viz. "<i>the fundamental opening
of all the powers that work both in Nature and
Grace</i>;" and who, perhaps more than any other individual,
experimentally lived and <i>fathomed</i> it.</p>

<p>Freher's original manuscripts and copies of
others (besides those formerly in the possession of
William Law), as well as the manuscripts of Law
and of Francis Lee, and some original documents
relating to the Philadelphian mystic author, Mrs.
Jane Lead (Lee's mother-in-law) are now in the
possession of Mr. Christopher Walton, of Ludgate
Street; who, I understand, is on the eve of completing,
for private circulation, a voluminous account
of these celebrated individuals. It will also
contain, if I am correctly informed, a representation
of the whole nature and scope of mystical
divinity and theosophical science, as apprehensible
from an <i>orthodox</i> evangelical&mdash;or, in a word, a
<i>standard</i> point of view; as likewise of the nature
and relations of the modern experimental transcendentalism
of Animal Magnetism, with its inductions
of the trance and <i>clairvoyance</i>, in respect
to the <i>astral</i> as well as <i>Divine</i> magic; with other
similar recondite, but now lost, philosophy. But
to return to Behmen.</p>

<p>The publication of the large edition of his
<i>Works</i> in question was undertaken at the sole
expense of Mrs. Hutcheson, one of the two ladies
who were Mr. Law's companions and friends in
his retirement at King's Cliffe, out of respect to
his memory; and who furnished the books Mr.
Law left behind him relating to this object. The
chief editor was a Mr. George Ward, assisted by
a Mr. Thomas Langcake, two former friends
and admirers of Law; who occasionally superintended
his pieces through the press, being then
resident in London. And the reason of this edition
not being completed was, that both Mrs.
Hutcheson and Mr. Ward died about the time of
the publication of the fourth volume; Mrs. Gibbon<a name="footnotetag3" href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>,
the aunt of the historian, it appears, not
being willing to continue the publication. All
that these parties did as editors was, to take the
original translations, change the phraseology here
and there without reference to the German original
(which language it is supposed they did not
understand), omit certain portions of the translator's
Prefaces, alter the capital letters of a few
words, and conduct the treatises through the press.</p>

<p>The literary productions which have commanded
the admiration and approbation of such
deep thinkers as Sir Isaac Newton<a name="footnotetag4" href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>, William Law,
Schelling, Hegel, and Coleridge, may perhaps,
before long, be thought worthy of republication.
What is required is a well-edited and correct
translation of Behmen's entire <i>Works</i>, coupled with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>{248}</span>
those of Freher, his great illustrator, (including
also the Emblems, &amp;c. of Gichtel's German
edition), and preceded by those of Law, which
treat upon the same subject, namely:&mdash;1. Answer
to Hoadley on the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper.
2. Christian Regeneration. 3. Animadversions on
Dr. Trapp. 4. The Appeal. 5. The Way to Divine
Knowledge. 6. The Spirit of Love. 7. Confutation
of Warburton. 8. Letters.</p>

<p>To conclude. The following are the terms in
which William Law speaks of Behmen's writings
in one of his letters:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Therein is opened the true ground of the unchangeable
<i>distinction between God and Nature</i>, making
all nature, whether temporal or eternal, its own proof
that it is not, cannot be, God, but purely and solely
the <i>want</i> of God; and can be nothing else in itself but
a restless painful want, till a supernatural God manifests
himself in it. This is a doctrine which the learned
of all ages have known nothing of; not a book, ancient
or modern, in all our libraries, has so much as attempted
to open the <i>ground</i> of nature to show its <i>birth</i>
and <i>state</i>, and its essential unalterable distinction from
the one <i>abyssal supernatural</i> God; and how all the
glories, powers, and perfections of the hidden, unapproachable
God, have their wonderful manifestation in
nature and creature."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And on another occasion:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the Revelation made to this wonderful man, the
first <i>beginning</i> of <i>all</i> things in eternity is opened; the
whole state, the <i>rise</i>, <i>workings</i>, and <i>progress</i> of all Nature
is revealed; and every doctrine, mystery, and precept
of the Gospel is found, not to have sprung from any
<i>arbitrary</i> appointment, but to have its <i>eternal</i>, <i>unalterable</i>
ground and reason in Nature. And God appears to
save us by the methods of the Gospel, because there
was no other possible way to save us in all the possibility
of Nature."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Now, though the difference between God and
Nature has always been supposed and believed, yet the
true ground of such distinction, or the <i>why</i>, the <i>how</i>,
and in <i>what</i> they are essentially different, and must be
so to all eternity, was to be found in no books, till the
goodness of God, in a way not less than that of <i>miracle</i>,
made a poor illiterate man, in the simplicity of a child,
to open and relate the deep mysterious <i>ground of all
things</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Thus much upon the "reveries" of our "poor
possessed cobbler." It may be well to add, that
Freher's writings (in sequence to those of Law
above named) are all but essential for the proper
understanding of Behmen, especially of his descriptions
of the <i>generation of Nature</i>, as to its <i>seven</i>
properties, <i>two</i> co-eternal principles, and <i>three</i>
constituent parts: which is the deepest and most
difficult point of all others to apprehend rightly
(that is, with intellectual clearness, as well as
sensitively in our own spiritual regeneration),
and indeed the key to every mystery of truth and
life.</p>

<p>Among the papers of this lady were found, after
her decease, several letters to her from her nephew,
Edward Gibbon, the historian, and his friend Lord
Sheffield, from which it would appear that the religious
views of the former had, at least from the year
1788, undergone considerable change. From one of
these interesting letters, shortly to be published, I
have been kindly permitted to make the following

religion as the best guide of youth, and the best support
of old age; that I firmly believe there is less real

<p>William Law, in the <i>Appendix</i> to the second edition
of his <i>Appeal to all that Doubt or Disbelieve the
Truths of the Gospel</i>, p. 314., 1756, mentions that
among the papers of Newton (now in Trinity College,
Cambridge) were found many autograph extracts from
the <i>Works</i> of Behmen. This is also confirmed in an
unpublished letter, now before me, from Law to Dr.
Cheyne in answer to his inquiries on this points. Law
affirms that Newton derived his system of fundamental
powers from Behmen; and that he avoided mentioning
Behmen as the originator of his system, lest it
should come into disrepute.</p>

<h3>PASSAGE IN MILTON.</h3>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"And every shepherd tells his tale</p>
    <p>Under the hawthorn, in the dale."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I have read with interest the "Notes" (Vol. i.,
pp. 286. 316.) on these lines of the Allegro; because,
in spite of early prepossession in favour of
the idea commonly attached to them, I was converted
some years ago, by the late Mr. Constable,
R.A., whose close observation of rural scenery
and employments no one can question.</p>

<p>His account of the matter was this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is usual in Suffolk, and I have seen it often myself,
for the shepherd, assisted by another man or boy,
to make the whole flock pass through a gap, in order
to facilitate the <i>tale</i>. One fellow drives them through
the opening, by moving about, shouting, and clapping
his hands, while his comrade, on the other side of the
hedge, and under cover of a thorn or other thick bush,
counts them as they leap through. I have not only
seen but assisted, when a boy, at the shepherd's tale;
and I do believe Milton had no other idea in his mind.
For, indeed, the early morning is not the time the
poets choose for lovers to woo, or maids to listen; and
Milton has described a scene where all were up and
stirring. Neither is the word 'every' appropriate,
according to the common interpretation of the passage;
<i>every</i> shepherd would not woo on the same spot; but
that spot might be particularly favourable for making
the tale of his sheep."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Your correspondent J. M. M. adduces an argument
in favour of the romantic <i>versus</i> the pastoral,
which seems to me entirely devoid of weight. He
thinks that Handel's "'Let no wander' breathes
the shepherd's tale of love." Surely there is more
imagination than truth in this. There is a <i>series</i>
of images in the words of that song: it was necessary,
unless the music varied unreasonably to suit
them all, to choose a pleasing, but not very significant,
melody, and, above all, to make the close of
it a fit introduction for the "merry bells," and
"jocund Rebecs," which burst in immediately
after. I confess I find nothing of the amatory
style in Handel's setting of the two disputed lines.
He chose the Pastorale or 6/8 time, as for "He shall
feed his flock," "O lovely Peace," &amp;c. But were
it so, I could not admit Handel as an authority,
because, as a foreigner, and an inhabitant of towns,
he could not possibly be conversant with the rural
customs of England.</p>

<h3>DESIGNED FALSE ENGLISH RHYMES.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. vii., p. 483.)</p>

<p>I was much surprised to see in your paper such
a lengthened defence of Irish rhymes by a reference
to those of English poets, and particularly to Pope.
I thought it was well known that he, at last, became
sensible of the cloying effect of his never-varying
melody, and sought to relieve it by deviations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>{250}</span>
from propriety. This is particularly remarkable in
his Homer, where he has numerous Irish rhymes
like "peace" and "race:" besides "war" and
"car;" "far," "dare;" with many other still more
barbarous metres. But all those were by regular
design for, if ever poet "lisped in numbers," it
was he; and "the numbers came" at his command.
He introduced those uncouth rhymes to somewhat
<i>roughen</i> his too long continued melody, just as
certain discords are allowed in great musical compositions.
It showed good judgment, for they are
an agreeable change by variation. Other English
poets too have false rhymes; for even Gray, in his
celebrated Elegy, has "toil" and "smile;" "abode"
and "God."</p>

<p>But, with respect to Irish poets, Swift should
not have been mentioned at all because, with
perhaps the exception of his "Cadenus and Vanessa,"
his poetry was of the doggerel kind; and
he purposely used Irish rhymes and debased
English. Thus, in the "Lady's Dressing-room:"</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Five hours, and who could do it less in?</p>
    <p>By haughty Celia spent in dressing."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Will any one say it was through ignorance that he
did not sound the <i>g</i> in dressing? Pope, in his
"Eloisa to Abelard," which is sweetness to excess,
concludes with:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"He best can paint 'em who has felt 'em most."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Why this is a downright vulgarism compared to
Swift's open and undisguised doggerel:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"<i>Libertas et natale solum</i>:</p>
    <p>Fine words! I wonder where you stole 'em."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Leaving Swift out of the question, Irish poets
are much more careful about their rhymes than
the English; because they know that what would
be excused or overlooked in them, would be
deemed ignorance on their own parts. I venture
to assert, that there are more false rhymes in
Pope's <i>Iliad</i> alone than in all the poems of Goldsmith
and Moore together; though I must again
observe that those of Pope were all intentional.</p>

<h3>ATTAINMENT OF MAJORITY.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. viii., p. 198.)</p>

<p>A. E. B. has not quoted quite correctly. He has
put two phrases of mine into Italics, which makes
them appear to have special relation to one another,
while the word which <i>I</i> put in Italics, "<i>ninth</i>," he
has made to be "9th." Farther, he has left out
some words. The latter part should run thus, the
words left out being in brackets:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"... though he were born [a minute before midnight]
on the 10th, he is of age to execute a settlement
at a minute after midnight on the morning of the 9th,
forty-eight hours all but two minutes before he has
drawn breath for the space of twenty-one years."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Had the quotation been correct, it would have
been better seen that I no more make the day of
majority begin a minute after midnight, than I
make the day of birth end a minute before midnight.
A second, or even the tenth of a second,
would have done as well.</p>

<p>The <i>old reckoning</i>, of which I was speaking, was
the reckoning which rejects fractions; and the matter
in question was the <i>day</i>. For my illustration,
any beginning of the day would have done as well
as any other; on this I must refer to the paper
itself. Nevertheless, I was correct in implying
that the day by which age is reckoned begins at
midnight and I believe it began at midnight in
the time of Ben Jonson. The law recognised two
kinds of days;&mdash;the natural day of twenty-four
hours, the artificial day from sunrise to sunset.
The birthday, and with it the day of majority,
would needs be the natural day; for otherwise
a child not born by daylight would have no birthday
at all. I cannot make out that the law ever
recognised a day of twenty-four hours beginning at
any hour except midnight. For payment of rent,
the artificial day was recognised, and the tenant
was required to tender at such time before sunset as
would leave the landlord time to count the money
by daylight; a reasonable provision, when we
think upon the vast number of different coins
which were legal tender. But even here it seems
to have been held that though the landlord might
enter at sunset, the forfeiture could not be enforced
if the rent were paid before midnight. A
legal friend suggested to me that perhaps Ben
Jonson had more experience of the terminus of the
day as between landlord and tenant, than of that
which emancipates a minor. This would not have
struck me: but a lawyer views man simply as the
agent or patient in distress, ejectment, <i>quo warranto</i>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>A. E. B. twice makes the question refer to
<i>usage</i>, whereas I was describing <i>law</i>. If I were
as well up in the drama as I should like to be, I
might perhaps find a modern plot which turns
upon a minor coming of age, in which the first
day of majority is what is commonly called the
<i>birthday</i>, instead of, as it ought to be, the day
before. Writers of fiction have in all times had
fictitious law. If we took decisions from the
novelists of our own day, we should learn, among
other things, that married women can in all circumstances
make valid wills, and that the destruction
of the parchment and ink which compose the
material of a deed is also the destruction of all
power to claim under it.</p>

<p>Singularly enough, this is the second case in
which my paper on reckoning has been both misquoted
and misapprehended in "N. &amp; Q." My
knowledge of the existence of this periodical began
with a copy of No. 7. (containing p. 107., Vol. i.),
forwarded to me by the courtesy of the Editor, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>{251}</span>
account of a Query signed (not A. E. B. but) B.,
affirming that I had "discovered a flaw in the
great Johnson!" Now it happened that the flaw
was described, even in B.'s own quotation from
me, as "certainly not Johnson's mistake, for he was
a clear-headed arithmetician." B. gave me half a
year to answer; and then, no answer appearing,
privately forwarded the printed Query, with a
request to know whether the readers of "N. &amp; Q."
were not of a class sufficiently intelligent to appreciate
a defence from me. The fact was, that I
thought them too intelligent to need it, after the
correction (by B. himself, in p. 127.) of the misquotation.
It is not in letters as in law, that
Judgment must be signed for the plaintiff if the
defendant do not appear. There is also an anonymous
octavo tract, mostly directed, or at least
(so far as I have read) much directed, against the
arguments of the same article, and containing, misapprehensions
of a similar kind. That my unfortunate
article should be so misunderstood in three
distinct quarters, is, I am afraid, sufficient presumption
against its clearness; and shows me that
<i>obscures fio</i> is, as much as ever, the attendant of
<i>brevis esse laboro</i>: but I am still fully persuaded
of the truth of the conclusions.</p>

<h3>LADY PERCY, WIFE OF HOTSPUR (DAUGHTER OF
EDMUND MORTIMER, EARL OF MARCH), AND
JANE SEYMOUR'S ROYAL DESCENT.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. vii., p. 42. Vol. viii., pp. 104. 184)</p>

<p>The mischief that arises from apparently the
most trifling inaccuracy in a statement of fact is
scarcely to be estimated. A mistake is repeated,
multiplied, and perpetuated often to an extent
that no after rectification can thoroughly efface.
Blunders even become sacred by antiquity; and
the attempt to correct any misstatement, if it does
not entirely fail through the subsequent destruction
of evidence that would have contained the
refutation, is frequently received with a coldness
and suspicion, and can seldom, with every aid from
undoubted sources, be brought to prevail against
the more familiar and preconceived impression.
An illustration of this may be seen in the reference
made by your correspondent C. V. to the
authority of Dugdale, as overriding the result of
later investigations relative to the issue respectively
of the fifth and seventh Lords Clifford of
Westmoreland. The loose and ill-advised assertion
of Miss Strickland, intended as it clearly was
to insinuate a mean origin in Jane Seymour, and
to lessen her pretension to an exalted birth, has
fortunately received a most complete and signal
disproof; but a question is now raised, which, if
it can be supported, will suit Miss Strickland's
view quite as well as her own inconclusive statement.
I cannot but think that what she wished
to say is, as hinted in the suggestion of C. V., that
the claim contended for cannot be supported
through the alleged marriage of a Wentworth with
the descendant of Elizabeth Percy, because Elizabeth,
Lady Percy's only daughter, Lady Elizabeth
de Percy, who married John, Lord Clifford, is by
<i>some</i> ancient heralds stated to have left no daughter.
This would have been an intelligible assertion,
and not entirely inconsistent with what may
be gathered from peerages, and other works compiled
solely upon the authority of Dugdale; and
it is indeed the very point of difficulty contemplated
by your learned correspondent C.V., who
if I do not mistake the signature, is himself an
authority entitled to much respect.</p>

<p>Dugdale, Collins, and Nicolas make the intermarriage
of Wentworth to have taken place with
a daughter of Roger, fifth Lord Clifford; and
Dugdale and Collins are silent as to any female
issue of John, the seventh Lord. Edmondson
(<i>Baronagium Genealogicum</i>, vol. iv. p. 364.)
adopts the same conclusion; but no higher authority
is cited by any one of the above writers, upon
which to found this statement. On the other
hand, both Collins and Edmondson, in the Wentworth
pedigree, show the marriage of Sir Philip
Wentworth, of Nettlested, to have taken place
with a daughter of John, seventh Lord Clifford.
Edmondson describes the daughter as <i>Elizabeth</i>;
but Collins more accurately calls her <i>Mary</i>.
Banks (<i>Baronage</i>, vol. ii. p. 90.) gives both statements
with an asterisk, implying a doubt as to
which of the two is to be accepted.</p>

<p>The Pembroke MS. contains a summary of the
lives of the Veteriponts, Cliffords, and the Earls
of Cumberland, compiled from original documents
and family records for the celebrated Lady Anne
Countess Dowager of Pembroke, daughter and
sole heir of George Clifford, Earl of Cumberland,
who died in 1605. This valuable collection gives
the most minute particulars and anecdotes connected
with the ancient family of the Lords
Clifford and their descendants, and being a few
years anterior in date to the publication of Dugdale's
<i>Baronage</i>, the information contained there
is entitled to the greatest possible weight as an
original and independent authority.</p>

<p>In this MS. (a copy of which is in the British
Museum, Harl. 6177.) the descendants of Roger,
fifth Lord Clifford, are named, but there is no
mention of any daughter who formed an alliance
with a Wentworth. Afterwards come the issue of
the marriage of John, seventh Lord Clifford, with
Elizabeth Percy, the only daughter of Henry
Lord Percy, surnamed Hotspur, son to Henry
Earl of Northumberland.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This Elizabeth Percy was one of the greatest
women of her time, both for her birth and her marriages,
&amp;c. Their eldest son, Thomas de Clifford,
succeeded his father both in his lands and honours, &amp;c.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>{252}</span>
Henry, their second son, died without issue, but is
mentioned in the articles of his brother's marriage.
Mary Clifford, married to Sir Philip Wentworth, Kt.,
of whom descended the Lords Wentworth that are
now living, and the Earl of Straffod, and the Earl of
Cleveland."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>To which of the above statements must we give
credit? If Dugdale be right, there will appear a
startling discrepance in the ages of the two persons
who are presumed to have formed the alliance in
question; whereas if the filiation given in the
Pembroke MS. is relied upon, their ages will be
quite consistent, and all the other circumstances
perfectly in accordance.</p>

<p>Roger, fifth Lord Clifford, was born and baptized
at Brougham on the 20th of July, 7 Edw. III.,
1333; his eldest son Thomas, sixth lord, was born
circa 1363, being twenty-six years old at his
father's death, which happened on 13th July,
1389, in the fifty-sixth year of his age. Thomas
Lord Clifford died on 4th of October, 1392,
leaving his son and heir John (seventh Lord
Clifford) an infant of about three years old.
This lord married the Lady Elizabeth de Percy
circa 1413, and his eldest son was born on 20th of
August, 1414: he died on 13th March, 1422.</p>

<p>The wife of Sir Philip Wentworth, were she a
daughter of Roger, fifth Lord Clifford, must have
been born between 1363 and 1389; if a daughter
of John, seventh Lord Clifford, she must have
been born between 1414 and 1422.</p>

<p>In my former note, it was shown that the father
and mother of Sir Philip Wentworth were married
before June, 1423; that Sir Philip was born circa
1424, and married in 1447; and that his eldest
son, Henry Wentworth, being thirty years of age
at his grandmother's death in 1478, must have
been born circa 1448. It is therefore clear, that
if his wife, Mary de Clifford, were a daughter of
the fifth Lord Clifford, she could not have been
less than thirty-five years older than her husband,
and sixty years old when her eldest son was born.
On the other supposition, she may have been
about the same age with her husband, or perhaps
two or three years only his senior.</p>

<p>Can there then be any longer a doubt that this
is a mistake of Dugdale? The other eminent
genealogists, cited by your correspondent, have
adopted the statement without farther investigation
and upon no better authority, and the error
has thus become familiarised by constant repetition.
Had the misrepresentation been set right
in the first instance, your readers would have
been spared the infliction of this lengthy confutation,
Miss Strickland herself protected from
the humiliation of a defeat, "in daring to dispute
a pedigree with King Henry VIII.;" and some of
the numerous living descendants of the Protector
Somerset been saved from much concern at finding
a pedigree demolished, through which they
had been wont to cherish the harmless vanity of
being allied to the honour of a royal lineage.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

<p><i>Three New Processes by Mr. Lyte.</i>&mdash;Will you
kindly allow me room in your pages for the insertion
of the following three processes, which may
not, perhaps, be uninteresting to some of your
readers? The first is respecting a very excellent
combination with which to excite collodion. The
second is on the subject of a capital developing
agent, and, I believe, a partially new one. The
third, a certain improvement in the production of
positives on albumen paper.</p>

<p>To make my collodion, I use the Swedish filtering
paper, as recommended by the Count de
Montizon, Mr. Crookes, &amp;c., not so much on account
of its superior properties, as the easier manipulation,
and the greater certainty of obtaining
a completely soluble substance. Having obtained
a clear and tolerably thick collodion, take</p>

<table class="nob" summary="Formula for combination with which to excite collodion">
  <tr>
    <td>Rectified spirits of wine</td>

    <td>gr.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Iodide of silver, freshly precipitated from the ammoniated
nitrate, as much as the solution thus
produced will take up&mdash;a small excess, which will
settle at the bottom, will not signify. Nearly the
same compound, one which is equally good, is
produced as follows. Take</p>

<table class="nob" summary="Formula for combination with which to excite collodion">
  <tr>
    <td>Rectified spirits of wine</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Chloride of silver</td>
    <td class="ar">5</td>
    <td>grs.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Whichever of these two sensitizers is used, take
1½ drachms, and add to every ounce of the collodion.</p>

<p>Collodion thus prepared is <i>most</i> rapid in its
action, giving a deep negative (with Ross's sixteen
guinea lens, and the developing agent I shall hereafter
describe) in ten seconds in clear weather,
and instantaneous positive pictures, which may be
afterwards darkened with the solution of terchloride
of gold, in chloride of ammonium. It
does not easily solarize, and, what is best of all,
gives the most pleasing half-tones.</p>

<p>I find it preferable, in taking landscapes, to
rather increase the quantity of the iodide of ammonium,
in order to give complete opacity to the
sky; but if the operator pleases, he may produce
the most admirable effect with the above-named
proportions, by painting in clouds at the back of
the plate with Indian ink: and this latter plan is
preferable, as the addition of more of the iodide
lowers the half-tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>{253}</span></p>

<p>If more of the chloride than above specified be
added, it will cause the plate to blacken all over
during development, before the extreme lights are
fully brought up.</p>

<p>My developing agent is made as follows. Take</p>

<table class="nob" summary="Formula for developing agent">
  <tr>
    <td>Distilled water</td>
    <td class="ar">10</td>
    <td>oz.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pyrogallic acid</td>
    <td class="ar">6</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Formic acid</td>
    <td class="ar">1</td>
    <td>oz.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The latter is not to be the concentrated acid, but
merely the commercial strength. These, when
mixed, form so powerful a developing agent, that
the picture is brought out in its full intensity,
almost instantly, while at the same time all the
deep shades are quite unaffected, and the half-tones
come out with a brilliancy I have never
seen before.</p>

<p>Another excellent developing agent is composed
as follows. Take</p>

<table class="nob" summary="Formula for developing agent">
  <tr>
    <td>Distilled water</td>
    <td class="ar">10</td>
    <td>oz.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sulphuric acid</td>
    <td class="ar">3</td>
    <td>drops.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Protosulphate of iron</td>
    <td class="ar">½</td>
    <td>oz.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Formic acid</td>
    <td class="ar">1</td>
    <td>oz.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The formic acid is also a most capital addition to
the protonitrate of iron, and either this or the
former liquid produce most brilliant positives
leaving a fine coating of white dead silver. I may
also make mention of the improvement I have
made in the albumen paper, which consists in the
introduction of the chloride of barium into the albumen,
in place of chloride of ammonium or chloride
of sodium. Take</p>

<table class="nob" summary="Formula for improvement in the production of
positives on albumen paper">

<p>Whip these up, till they are converted entirely
into a white froth; when this has settled into
liquid, pour it into a tall jar, and allow the precipitate,
which will then separate, to settle completely,
and strain the supernatant liquid through
fine muslin. The paper, being laid on the surface
of this fluid for a space of from five to ten minutes,
may be taken off and hung up by a crooked
pin to dry, and then ironed. It is to be sensitized
with nitrate of silver, 120 grains to the ounce of
water. The setting liquid I use is prepared according
to the formula given by me in Vol. vii.,
p. 534. of your journal, except that I prefer to
use half to one grain of pyrogallic acid, and 120
grains of chloride of silver. This paper must be
soaked for a few minutes or so in rain water, after
being printed, before being placed in the hypo.;
the presence in the water of any salt seems to destroy
the tone of this paper.</p>

<p><i>Muller's Processes&mdash;Sisson's Developing Solution.</i>&mdash;I
am glad to find that I have called the
attention of your photographic correspondents to
Mr. Muller's process, as detailed in <i>The Athenæum</i>
of Nov. 22, 1851, which seems to have been
strangely overlooked and neglected. As your
correspondents have induced you to reprint the
article, perhaps you will also yield to my request,
and reprint an article from the same journal of
later date (Jan. 10, 1852) containing another
process, more economical and more sensitive than
the other, invented also by Mr. Muller, and the
value of which I have proved. In that, as in the
other, there is no developing agent required. To
save time I have copied from my note-book the
article itself, and append it to this communication.</p>

<p>A photographer of several years' standing informs
me that my developing solution produces
excellent negatives upon glass, and that he has
been trying it as a bath with success. He writes
me:&mdash;"I use your developing solution for negatives
only; and by using a very small opening,
say about 3/10ths of an inch diameter, single achromatic
lens, I have produced negatives in one
minute, which print most beautiful bright positives.
The views I have taken and developed with your
solution were without sunshine, the sky very
cloudy, three o'clock p.m. The collodion was prepared
by Messrs. Knight &amp; Son."</p>

<p>Since I received his letter I have tried a negative
so developed, with the best success; and I
attribute the success to the fact that you may go
on developing with that solution any length of
time almost, without any fear of spoiling the
negative, thus getting thickness of deposit; and
that the deposit on pictures taking so long a time
to develop has a very perceptible yellow tinge,
which, like the gold in Professor Maconochie's
method (detailed in <i>Photographic Journal</i> for this
month), stops the chemical rays.</p>

<p>"Plain paper is floated on a bath of acetonitrate
of silver, prepared of 25 grs. of nitrate of
silver, 1 fluid oz. of water, 60 minims of strong
acetic acid. When well moistened on one side,
the paper is removed, and lightly dried with
blotting-paper; it is then placed with the prepared side
downwards on the surface of a bath of hydriodate
of iron (8 grs. of the iodide in 1 oz. of silver). It
is not allowed to remain on this solution, for if this
were the case it would become almost insensitive.
The silvered surface must be simply moistened
with the hydriodate&mdash;the object being to get a
minimum quantity of it diffused equally over the
silvered surface. The photographer accustomed
to delicacy of manipulation will find no difficulty
in this. While still wet the paper is placed upon
a glass (face downwards), and exposed in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>{254}</span>
camera for periods varying from 10 to 60 seconds,
according to circumstances. In sunshine, and
when the object to be copied is bright, 5 seconds
in this climate (India) is sufficient. Excellent
portraits are obtained in shade in 30 seconds; 60
seconds is the maximum of exposure. The picture
is removed from the camera and allowed to
develop itself spontaneously in the dark, then
soaked in water, and fixed in the usual manner
with the hyposulphite of soda."&mdash;<i>Athenæum</i>,

<p><i>Spiked Maces represented in the Windows of
the Abbey Church, Great Malvern.</i>&mdash;There is an
instrument of this nature described by some of the
martyrologists under the name of "Scorpio," and
figured by Hieronymus Magius (Jerome Maggi)
in his treatise <i>De Equuleo</i>. It is there represented
as a thick stick, set with iron points, and
was used, together with rods, and the plumbetæ or
loaded chain scourges, to torment the confessors.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think, however, that the weapons
represented in the windows at Great Malvern
are intended for morning stars, which were much
employed in arming the watch in the cities of
northern Europe in the Middle Ages, and at a
later period as well. This weapon (a variety of
which was called holy-water sprinkle, from the
brush-like arrangement of its spikes) had a long
shaft like a halbert, and is often introduced in
paintings of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
as borne by the Jewish guard who appear
in the various scenes of Our Lord's Passion.</p>

<p>Of course the artists represented their characters
as wearing the dress and provided with arms
of their own period; as we see the Roman soldiers
at the foot of the cross in some German and Dutch
pictures, mere portraits of the sworders and swashbucklers
of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>I may mention that a weapon of this coarse
description is generally put into the hands of a
ruffian, or at least of some very inferior character.
In <i>La Mort D'Artur</i>, Sir Lancelot encounters
on a bridge "a passing foul churl," who disputes
his passage, and "lashes at him with a great club,
full of iron pins."</p>

<p>I remember seeing a barbarous weapon taken
from a piratical vessel, which consisted of a massive
wooden club, heavily loaded with lead, furnished
with a spike at the smaller end, and thickly
studded with iron nails, tenter hooks, and the
hammers of gun locks. This was something like the
old Danish club.</p>

death of Liberalitie," 1598, is one of the pieces,
and on the first page of signature C. the word <i>its</i>
occurs, but as a contraction of <i>it is</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"The maimed souldier comming from the warre;</p>
    <p class="i1">The woefull wight, whose house was lately burnd;</p>
    <p>The sillie soule; the woful traueylar;</p>
    <p class="i1">And all, whom Fortune at her feet hath spurnd;</p>
    <p class="i4">Lament the losse of Liberalitie;</p>
    <p class="i1"><i>Its</i> ease to haue in griefe some companie."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>{255}</span></p>

<p>While on the opposite page we have "<i>it</i> soule"
for "<i>its</i> soule," thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"But as a woefull mother doeth lament,</p>
    <p class="i1">Her tender babe, with cruel death opprest;</p>
    <p>Whose life was spotlesse, pure and innocent,</p>

    <p>So Bountie, which herselfe did upright keepe,</p>
    <p>Yet for her losse, loue cannot chuse but weepe."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>May not this lead to the conclusion that it was
to avoid confusion with the ellipsis of <i>it is</i>, that
the possessive case was thus written <i>it</i>?</p>

<p><i>"Hip, hip, hurrah!"</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 20. 185.).&mdash;No
one, I think, who heard the cheering of the
ships' companies at the late naval review can
doubt that <span class="sc">Cheverell's</span> explanation of "hip, hip,"
is the true one. They are not <i>words</i>, but interjectional
<i>sounds</i>; with no other meaning than to
prepare for and <i>time</i> the coming "hurrah!"
When the men are ready to cheer, the boatswain's
mate gives the signal "hip, hip," and then follows
the general "hurrah!" This practice is adopted
in public assemblies for the same reason&mdash;to ensure
concert and unity in the final cheer. "Hurrah!"
also I take (<i>pace</i> Sir F. Palgrave) to be a mere
<i>sound</i>: a <i>natural</i> exclamation of pleasure, with no
more instrinsic meaning than "Oh!" or "Ah!"
for pain, or "Bah!" for contempt. It surely can
have no connexion with the phrase of old Norman
law&mdash;"clameurs de haro:" for "haro" is an
exclamation of dissent and opposition. "Crier
<i>haro</i> sur quelqu'un," is to excite mischief and scandal
against him&mdash;the very reverse of <i>hurrah</i>!</p>

<p><i>Derivation of "Wellesley"</i> (Vol. viii., p. 173.).&mdash;In
reply to J. M., I think the following particulars I
may not be uninteresting to him. There is good
reason to believe that the name of Wellesley was
derived from an ancient manor about one mile
south of Wells, called Wellesleigh, which once,
belonged to the Bishops of Bath and Wells. It is
certain that a family called "De Wellsleigh" lived,
and held considerable lands in this manor at a
very remote period. In 1253, a Philip de Wellsleigh,
and in 1349 another of the same name, are
recorded as holding part of the manor of the
Bishops of Bath and Wells. These lands, with
the serjeanty and office of bailiff and "cryer of
the hundred," passed into the family of the Hills
of Spaxton, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1435. In 7 Henry VII., John
Stourton held half a knight's fee in this manor:
"formerly held by William de Wellsleigh." I
have an original deed in my possession dated 26th
Edward I., being a feoffment or grant of lands in
Dinder (an adjoining parish) by William Le
Fleming, "Dn̄s de Dynder," in which "Thomas
de Welesleȝe" and "Robert de Welesleȝe" (so
the name is spelt) are, among others, named as
witnesses. This manor was held by the Bishops
of Bath and Wells until the time of Ralph de
Salopia (succeeded <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1329, died <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1363), who
gave it to the vicars choral of the cathedral, by
who it has been held down to the last year (1852),
when they sold the fee of it to Robert Charles
Tudway, Esq., M.P. for Wells.</p>

<p><i>Penny-come-quick</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 8. 113. 184.).&mdash;Your
correspondents on the subject of this name
do not appear to be aware that there is a place
also so called in Ireland: a small public-house,
and one or two others, on the high road between
Wicklow and Arklow, near the sea-shore, three
miles north of the latter town. In Taylor and
Skinners Road Maps of Ireland (1776), it is
spelled "Penny-<i>con</i>-quick." I have been there,
and do not think that the site countenances
H. C. K.'s ingenious etymology.</p>

an order of the queen in council, 17th of April,
1707, consequent upon the union of Scotland with
England, it was declared in what manner the ensigns
armorial of the United Kingdom (called
Great Britain) should thenceforth be borne;

<p><i>Longevity</i> (Vol. vii., p. 368. &amp;c.).&mdash;Several of
the upland parishes bordering on the river Yare
have had remarkable instances of longevity. One
of the best authenticated was a man named Pottle,
who resided on the Reedham estate of the late
J. F. Leathes, Esq., of Herringfleet. When
Pottle was 104 years old, the tenantry on the
estate subscribed to have his portrait painted,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>{256}</span>
which they presented to their landlord, each retaining
a lithograph copy of it. Many of these
copies I have seen. Two years after this I conversed with
the old man, who was then keeping
cows on a common. There was nothing remarkable
about him except his voice, which was very
loud and powerful. He has now been dead some
time, but I do not know his exact age at death.</p>

<p>In the register of burials for the parish of
Runham, Norfolk, is this entry:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"August 12, 1788. William Russels, aged One
hundred and one years."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The clergyman has entered the age in round text-hand,
evidently that the entry might not escape

<p><i>Green Pots used for drinking from by Members
of the Temple</i> (Vol. viii., p. 171.).&mdash;The green
pots mentioned in Sir Julius Cæsar's letter had
been introduced into the Inner Temple about
thirty years before its date. This appears from
the following passage in Dugdale's <i>Origines Juridiciales</i>
(1680), p. 148., where he refers to the
register of that Society, fol. 127 <i>a.</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Untill the second year of Q. Eliz. reign, this Society
did use to drink in Cups of Ashen-Wood (such
as are still used in the King's Court), but then those
were laid aside, and green earthen pots introduced,
which have ever since continued."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>When were these green pots discontinued?
Paper Buildings were erected nearly fifty years
before Dugdale's time. The new part built in
1849 was on the south of these, which may,
perhaps, have been the site of the dust-hole of the
Society, and thus become the depositary of the
broken pots mentioned by B.</p>

<p><i>Shape of Coffins</i> (Vol. viii., p. 104.).&mdash;As bearing
somewhat upon <span class="sc">Mr. Ellacombe's</span> Query, allow
me to remark that when travelling a few years
since in the United States, having about an hour's
delay in the city of Rochester, N. Y., I entered
one of the churches during a funeral service.
When the ceremony (at which a considerable number
of persons attended) was concluded, the
congregation left their seats and walked in very
orderly procession towards the reading-desk, in
front of which was placed the coffin, without any
pall or covering. They then slowly walked round it,
in order, as I afterwards found, to take their
last look at the departed. This they were enabled
to do without the removal of the lid, by raising
the upper or head portion of it, which was hinged
a square of glass beneath allowing the face to be
seen. This strange custom, which, for my own
part, I think would be "more honoured by the
breach than the observance," as the recollection
of the living face to me is far preferable to that
of death, I do not remember to have seen noticed
by any of our many travellers in America, though
I afterwards found it to be general. The coffins,
which are somewhat differently shaped to ours,
sloping towards the feet, are rarely covered with
cloth; but are generally made of some hard wood
such as walnut, highly polished.</p>

<p><i>Old Fogies</i> (Vol. viii., p. 154.).&mdash;There may
be too much of even a good thing, and I wish
some of the writers in "N. &amp; Q." would study
compression a little. A short paragraph which I
wrote, more in jest than earnest, on the above
phrase, has drawn down on me no less than two
columns from J. L. But this comes of meddling
with Scotland.</p>

<p>One might fancy that J. L. was the Irish, not
the Scottish advocate, for he proves the prior
claim of Scotland by showing that the word which
I had stated to have been in use in Dublin in the
first half of the last century, was known in Edinburgh
in the last half of it. He must also excuse
my saying that he does not seem ever to have
studied etymology, one of the rules of which is,
that if a probable origin of a word can be found in
the language to which it belongs, we should not
seek elsewhere. Now <i>fogie</i> (i.e. <i>folkie</i>, the Dutch
<i>volkje</i>) comes as surely from <i>folk</i>, as <i>lassie</i> from
<i>lass</i>, or any other diminutive from its primitive.
I now have done with the subject.</p>

<p><i>Swan-marks</i> (Vol. viii., p 62.).&mdash;<span class="sc">W. Collyn's</span>
remark on swan-marks may mislead; therefore it
is worth noting that "the swan with two necks" is
not "a corruption of the <i>private</i> mark of the owner
of the swans, viz. two nicks made by cutting the
<i>neck feathers</i> close in two places." The nicks were
made in the <i>beak</i>; and the privilege of having
swan-marks was by grant from the crown.</p>

<p>The Vintners' Company's mark for their swans
on the Thames was two nicks; hence a two-nicked
swan was a very appropriate sign for a tavern.
The royal swans are marked with five nicks, two
lengthwise, and three across the bill (See Hone's<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>{257}</span>
<i>Every-day Book</i>, 1827, p. 963; Yarrell's <i>British
Birds</i>; Jardine's <i>Nat. Lib.</i>; <i>Penny Cyclop.</i>, art.
"Swan.") It is to be noted, however, that Hone
is in error in saying the two nicks are the <i>royal</i>
swan-mark.</p>

<p><i>Limerick, Dublin, and Cork</i> (Vol. viii., p. 102.).&mdash;I
should think the author of this doggrel couplet,
if we are to consider it as a fair specimen of his
poetic genius, may safely be permitted to remain
in obscurity. Be that as it may, the lines are by
no means new, nor are they confined to the sister
isle alone. In the <i>Prophecies of Nixon</i>, the Cheshire
Merlin, who lived nobody knows when,
except that it was certainly a "long time ago," we
are given to understand that:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"London streets shall run with blood,</p>
    <p class="i1">And at last shall sink</p>
    <p>So that it shall be fulfilled,</p>
    <p>That Lincoln was, London is, and York shall be</p>
    <p class="i1">The finest city of the three."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>As I have just stated, the original date of these
<i>Prophecies</i> is somewhat involved in mystery; but
I myself possess copies of three different editions
published during the last century, the first of the
three, purporting to be the sixth edition, bearing
date London, 1719. A Life of Nixon, affixed to
this edition, states him to have lived and prophesied
in the reign of King James I.; at whose court,
we are farther told, he was, in conformity with
his own prediction, starved to death. His <i>Prophecies</i>
are, by the learned, held to be apocryphal;
the country folk of Cheshire, on the contrary,
have as much faith in them and their author as
they have in the fact of their own existence.</p>

<p><i>Character of the Song of the Nightingale</i>
(Vol. vii., p. 397.; Vol. viii., p. 112.).&mdash;Although
Milton seems to have generally used the epithet
<i>solemn</i> in its classical sense (as cleverly pointed
out by <span class="sc">Mr. Sydney Gedge</span>), and meant to represent
the nightingale as the <i>customary</i> attendant of
night, yet there is at least one passage where the
epithet appears to me not to have this meaning;
but to express that the song of the nightingale
caused "a holy joy," and was heard not only in
the day-time, but all through the night. For
although Milton calls the nightingale "the night-warbling
bird," and so makes it "the customary
attendant of the night," yet he also elsewhere as
truly speaks of it as a <i>day</i> singer. The passage I
referred to is in <i>Paradise Lost</i>, book vii., and
seems to me to bear the meaning above spoken of;
though <span class="sc">Mr. Gedge</span> may perhaps make "solemn"
refer back to the last noun "even." And I confess
that the meaning seems dubious:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"From branch to branch, the smaller birds with song</p>
    <p>Solac'd the woods, and spread their painted wings</p>
    <p>Till even; nor then the solemn nightingale</p>
    <p>Ceas'd warbling, but all night tun'd her soft lays."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I can add one other epithet to the one hundred
and nine which I have already given of the nightingale's
song:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p><i>Wond'ring.</i> Dryden ("Palamon and Arcite").</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I may add, that Otway and Grainger (erroneously
printed Graingle) appear to have used
"solemn" in the ordinary meaning of the word.</p>

<p><i>Adamson's "Lusitania Illustrata"</i> (Vol. viii.,

consult the following works with great advantage:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Résumé de l'Histoire Littéraire du Portugal, suivi
du Résumé de l'Histoire Littéraire du Brésil, 12mo.:
Paris, 1826."</p>

<p>"Parnaso Lusitano, ou Poesias selectas dos auctores
Portuguezos antigos e modernos, illustrados cum notas,
percedido de una Historia abreviada da lingua e
poesia Portugueza, tom. v., 18mo. Paris, 1826."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The destruction by fire of Mr. Adamson's
library, which was so rich in Portuguese literature,
has, with other circumstances, hitherto prevented
the continuation of the <i>Lusitania Illustrata</i>;
but the appearance of future parts, in furtherance
of the original plan, is by no means abandoned.</p>

<p><i>Adamsoniana</i> (Vol. vii., p. 500.; Vol. viii.,
p. 135.).&mdash;I was aware of the way in which the
famous naturalist spelt his name, but supposed
that Michel Ada<i>n</i>son and Michael Ada<i>m</i>son were
the same, the former being merely the French
mode of writing according to their pronunciation.
I was also aware of the leading events in the
naturalist's own career, but was desirous if possible
of identifying his father: "the gentleman
who, after firmly attaching himself to the Stuarts,
left Scotland, and entered the service of the
Archbishop of Aix."</p>

<p>Perhaps I may be more fortunate in obtaining
some information respecting another Scot of the
same name: James Adamson, for thirty-one years
rector of Tigh, in Rutlandshire, who is described
in the inscription upon his tombstone as "natu
Scotus, Anglus vita, moribus antiquis, cum rege
suo in prosperis et adversis." I believe he was
the father of John Adamson, M.A., Rector Of
Burton Coggles, in Lincolnshire: the author of
two sermons; one published in 1698, and entitled
<i>The Duty of Daily frequenting the Public Service</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>{258}</span>
of the Church; another in 1707, being
the <i>Funeral Sermon for Sir E. Turnor of Stoke

to Lord Byron's <i>own</i> ignorance of the meaning of
an expression in this stanza, expressed in a letter
to Murray, published in Moore's <i>Life</i>, Letter 323,
dated Venice, 24th September, 1818, when, after
pointing out an error in the same canto, he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"What does 'thy waters <i>wasted</i> them' mean? <i>That
is not me.</i> Consult the MS. always."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And in a note by Moore on this letter, he says,
"This passage retains <i>also</i> uncorrected."</p>

<p>At the end of this letter Byron writes, "<i>I saw the
canto by accident.</i>" Query: If Byron only saw
his cantos by "accident," would not a new edition
of his works collated with his MSS. be "a consummation

the children of Hannah Smith, Newton's half-sister,

<p>"This light and pleasant Farina is one of the
most excellent, nourishing, and restorative
remedies, and supersedes, in many cases, all
kinds of medicines. It is particularly useful
in confined habit of body, as also diarrhœa,
bowel complaints, affections of the kidneys and
bladder, such as stone or gravel; inflammatory
irritation and cramp of the urethra, cramp of
the kidneys and bladder, strictures, and hemorrhoids.
This really invaluable remedy is employed
with the most satisfactory result, not
only in bronchial and pulmonary complaints,
where irritation and pain are to be removed,
but also in pulmonary and bronchial consumption,
in which it counteracts effectually the
troublesome cough; and I am enabled with
perfect truth to express the conviction that Du
Barry's Revalenta Arabica is adapted to the
cure of incipient hectic complaints and consumption.</p>

its history and traced its
progress in England by means of the records
of expenses and mandates of the successive
Sovereigns of the realm&mdash;Mr. Hudson Turner
has now achieved for Domestic Architecture in
this country during the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries."&mdash;<i>Architect.</i></p>

<p>"The writer of the present volume ranks
among the most intelligent of the craft, and
a careful perusal of its contents will convince
the reader of the enormous amount of labour
bestowed on its minutest details, as well as the
discriminating judgment presiding over the
general arrangement."&mdash;<i>Morning Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>"The book of which the title is given above
is one of the very few attempts that have been
made in this country to treat this interesting
subject in anything more than a superficial
manner.</p>

<p>"Mr. Turner exhibits much learning and
research, and he has consequently laid before
the reader much interesting information. It
is a book that was wanted, and that affords us
some relief from the mass of works on Ecclesiastical
Architecture with which of late years
we have been deluged.</p>

<p>"The work is well illustrated throughout
with wood-engravings of the more interesting
remains, and will prove a valuable addition to
the antiquary's library."&mdash;<i>Literary Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"It is as a text-book on the social comforts
and condition of the Squires and Gentry of
England during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,
that the leading value of Mr. Turner's
present publication will be found to consist.</p>

all important existing remains, made from

By the Editor of "The Glossary of Architecture."</p>

<p>This volume is issued on the plan adopted by
the late Mr. Hudson Turner in the previous
volume: viz., collecting matter relating to
Domestic buildings of the Period, from cotemporary
records, and applying the information
so acquired to the existing remains.</p>

<p>Not only does the volume contain much
curious information both as to the buildings
and manners and customs of the time, but it is
also hoped that the large collection of careful
Engravings of the finest examples will prove as
serviceable to the profession and their employers
in building mansions, as the Glossary
was found to be in building churches.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
